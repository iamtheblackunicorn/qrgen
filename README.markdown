# QR Gen

***Generate QR Codes. :clown_face: :baseball:***

## About :books:

I needed a little Python script to generate a QR code, this is that script.

## Installation :hammer:

To install QR Gen, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Python 3.x
- `Pip` for Python 3.x (Usually comes with Python 3.)
- `Pillow` for Python 3.x
- `qrcode` for Python 3.x

To install the last two tools, install them with `pip install name`.

Once this is done, download the script and run it from the command-line:

```bash
$ python3 qrgen.py --fname someqrcode.png
```

You will be then asked for the data, type it in and confirm. That's it.
There will be an image file with the name `someqrcode.png`.
